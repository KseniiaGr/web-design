        <h1> Early years </h1>
        <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 into a Dutch Reformed family in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the southern Netherlands. He was the oldest child of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. For the first 30 years of his life Vincent thought to become and priest, but seeing the life of peasants he wanted to bring it to the eye of people. So he became a self tought painter with the help of his brother Theo.  </p>

        <h1> Emerging artist </h1>
        <p>In 1883 Van Gogh focused on painting and drawing after moovin to Nuenen. Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages. Van Gogh painted several groups of still lifes in 1885. During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he completed numerous drawings and watercolours, and nearly 200 oil paintings. His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and showed no sign of the vivid colours that distinguish his later work. </p>

        <h1> Artistic breakthrough</h1>
        <p> The time in Arles in 1888 became one of Van Gogh's more prolific periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours. He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period are rich in colours. After much pleading from Van Gogh, Gauguin arrived in Arles on 23 October, and in November the two painted together. In December 1888, their relationship began to deteriorate; Van Gogh admired Gauguin, but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering. </p>

        <h1> Hospital </h1>
        <p>The exact sequence of events which led to Van Gogh's mutilation of his ear is not known, but it has certanly started with a fight with Gauguin. Van Gogh entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum on 8 May 1889. The clinic and its garden became the main subjects of his paintings.  Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls, such as The Starry Night. On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest. Within hours Vincent began to fail, suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound. He died in the early hours of 29 July.  </p>
