        <h1> Early years </h1>
        <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 into a Dutch Reformed family in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the southern Netherlands. He was the oldest child of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. For the first 30 years of his life Vincent thought to become and priest, but seeing the life of peasants he wanted to bring it to the eye of people. So he became a self tought painter with the help of his brother Theo.  </p>

        <h1> Emerging artist </h1>
        <p>In 1883 Van Gogh focused on painting and drawing after moovin to Nuenen. Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages. Van Gogh painted several groups of still lifes in 1885. During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he completed numerous drawings and watercolours, and nearly 200 oil paintings. His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and showed no sign of the vivid colours that distinguish his later work.The next two yeasr were hard for the painter as the woman he loved, Margot Begemann, wasnt able to marry him and distraught tried to commit suicide. Vincent moved back in with his family and continued drawing. </p>

        <h1> Artistic breakthrough</h1>
        <p> Vinvent van Gogh moved to Arles in 1888. He wasnt successful through his carreer, so he couldnt allow himself to spend a lot of money on food or housing, so he ended up moving south. The time in Arles became one of Van Gogh's more prolific periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours. He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, ultramarine and mauve. During that time he became friends with a lot of painters and invited them to join him. After much pleading from Van Gogh, Gauguin arrived in Arles on 23 October, and in November the two painted together. Gauguin depicted Van Gogh in his The Painter of Sunflowers; Van Gogh painted pictures from memory, following Gauguin's suggestion. Their in December 1888,relationship began to deteriorate; Van Gogh admired Gauguin and wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering, which frustrated Van Gogh. </p>

        <h1> Hospital and Death </h1>
        <p>The exact sequence of events which led to Van Gogh's mutilation of his ear is not known, but it has certanly started with a fight with Gauguin.Theo rushed to the station to board a night train to Arles. He arrived on Christmas Day and comforted Vincent, who seemed to be semi-lucid. That evening he left Arles for the return trip to Paris. Van Gogh entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum on 8 May 1889. Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows, one of which was he used as a studio. The clinic and its garden became the main subjects of his paintings.  Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls, such as The Starry Night. On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest. The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs. He was able to walk back to the Auberge Ravoux, where he was attended to by two doctors, but without a surgeon present the bullet could not be removed. Within hours Vincent began to fail, suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound. He died in the early hours of 29 July.  </p>
